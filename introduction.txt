Hello! My name is Katherine. I am a second-year student at BU studying Data Science and Biology (most likely on the dual degree track)!

My favorite class at BU so far is probably one I am taking right now, BI509, which is Metapopulation Ecology, the study of "populations of populations" within ecology. I am taking it as a bio elective and for a Writing Intensive Hub, and it's cool to dive deep into such a niche topic!
